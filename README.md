## F.A.Q.
>Q: You mentioned this is compatible with all kinds of web browsers, but I can't find the setting to change the New Tab page in mine. What do I do?
>
>A: Some browsers don't allow changing the New Tab page. In such cases, you can use extensions like [Fast New Tab Redirect](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fast-new-tab-redirect/ohnfdmfkceojnmepofncbddpdicdjcoi) for Chrome or [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/) for Firefox. Alternatively, you can set your start page (homepage) to the location of `index.html`.

>Q: How do I use this on my phone?
>
>A: Use a browser that allows you to change the New Tab page, or set your start page (homepage) to the location of `index.html`.

>Q: Is mobile support available?
>
>A: Yes, it is. However, you'll need to find a way to store `index.html` on your phone or host it, which I do not provide support for.

>Q: Why should I export my settings?
>
>A: In case you need to reinstall your browser or switch to a different one. Also, in rare instances, your browser may reset your settings. If that happens, you can import your settings so you won't have to set everything up again.

>Q: I have a feature suggestion!
>
>A: Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
